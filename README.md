🚕# Uber_Ride_Analytics

This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to Uber ride data, uncovering insights into ride frequency, time-based trends, popular locations, and user behavior patterns. The goal is to turn raw data into actionable insights using Python and data visualization libraries.

📝 Project Description

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Uber ride data aimed at uncovering usage patterns, ride trends, and consumer behavior across time and geography. By analyzing data from Uber’s NYC ride-sharing services, we investigate temporal patterns in ride demand, hotspot locations for pickups, and how rides vary by month, day, and hour.

🎯 Objective

- Understand how ride volume fluctuates across different times of day, week and month.

- Visualize spatial trends to pinpoint high-demand pickup zones.

- Generate actionable insights for business decision-making (e.g., surge pricing, driver allocation).

- Practice data cleaning, transformation, and visualization using Python.

⚙️ Process

- Data Collection:

Loaded Uber raw data from CSV files containing ride timestamps and location data.

- Data Preprocessing:

- Parsed timestamps into new features (hour, day, weekday, month).

- Handled missing values and duplicates.

- Exploratory Analysis:

- Plotted ride frequencies by hour, day of the week, and month.

-Created CATEGORY AND PURPOSE wise ride bookings.

- Visualization Tools:

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create:
- Bar charts of hourly and daily trends.

- Line graphs to detect seasonality in rides.

- Bar charts of category and purpose wise ride bookings.

- Boxplot to check the distribution of the miles.

  🔍 Key Insights

- Ride demand peaks during commute hours: Most pickups occur around 8–10 AM and 5–7 PM.

- Monthly variations reveal seasonality — ride volume tends to spike during summer and dip in colder months.

- Specific areas (e.g., downtown or near transport hubs) consistently show higher ride frequency, which can guide resource deployment.

 🧠 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how powerful insights can be extracted from raw data through EDA. 
By visualizing patterns in Uber rides, we can understand rider behavior, optimize services, and inform strategic decisions. It also serves as a solid foundation for predictive analytics or demand forecasting in ride-hailing platforms.
